The problem with a lot of the above is that user space does not know how to
parse them. "jiffies_to_msecs" depends on knowing the HZ value. Now if the
kernel exported this, we could look for it and save this information, and
then be able to parse it correctly.

Correct. As __builtin_expect() is just a compile time optimization that
"likely()" and "unlikely()" are defined to, it has no meaning to the
parser. But we still want the contents of the expression.

I had to update libtraceevent to basically ignore the __builtin_expect().

That is, "unlikely(cond)" turns into "!!__builtin_exepect(cond, 0)"

libtraceevent does not care about the "unlikely()" part, only the
condition, so the parser basically treats it the same:

  "unlikely(cond)" == "cond"

What is using __builting_constant_p() inside the TP_printk()?

When it can't parse something, it falls back to just printing out the raw
fields the best it can.

It affects how it prints the event. It then ignores the TP_printk() format,
and then, as mentioned above, just prints the raw fields.

I have to see how it's used. What event does that?
