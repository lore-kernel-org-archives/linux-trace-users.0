Hi Steven:

Sorry for the same message, I failed to add Mauro to the discussion, so 
I resend the same thread.

I find this kernel 
patch(https://lore.kernel.org/all/477b362dba1ce7fab9889a1a8e885a62c472f041.1516069914.git.tom.zanussi@linux.intel.com/T/#u) 
change TIME_STAMP to 8 bytes. Maybe this commit is the first time 
RINGBUF_TYPE_TIME_STAMP is really implemented in the kernel.

When rasdaemon use old libtrace(12 byte version of TIME_STAMP) on newer 
kernel(8 bytes version of RINGBUF_TYPE_TIME_STAMP). Libtrace takes too 
long to parse timestamp events and appends the first 4 bytes of the next 
trace event as the last 4 bytes of the timestamp event. Such wrong 
parsing will lead to completely wrong parsing of the adjacent trace 
event field. For example, in rasdaemon we have a situation like this, 
libtrace parse devlink_health_report trace event next timestamp trace 
event as block_rq_complete trace event, which will cause coredump in 
block_rq_complete rasdaemon handler.

I am worried similar libtraceevent-kernel compatibility problem. I think 
it's a good way to sort out the interfaces that libtraceevent depends on 
the kernel and add test cases to determine whether libtraceevent can run 
on the current kernel, or to know which interfaces do not match.

rasdaemon now use the external libtraceevent, but rasdaemon will be 
shipped in many version OS by OSV, so how to ensure that rasdaemon runs 
correctly on various kernel versions using external libtraceevent needs 
to be considered.
