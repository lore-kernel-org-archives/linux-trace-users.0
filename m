Yes, the fix was to use strdup(). It wasn't even a thread issue, nor a
library issue, as the code in question is part of the trace-cmd executable
and not the libraries. The problem was that it modified the environment
variable and then reused that same environment variable in the exec()
operation :-p

That's why I now always use strtok_r() by default. It is thread (and
library) safe. I avoid using strtok() even when it's perfectly fine to do
so.
