The difference is that one is an optimization for the compiler, where the
output will always be the same. The other changes what the value will be
depending on what the kernel HZ is.

I chose to fail parsing if we cannot prove that the output has integrity.

Correct.

Now what we could do for undefined functions, is to keep the warning that
it doesn't know how to interpret it, but instead of failing to parse, to
instead show the function in the output:

For the event ata_qc_issue (the first one I found when doing a
"trace-cmd record -e all" that failed to parse):

It has in its TP_printk()

   libata_trace_parse_subcmd(p, REC->cmd, REC->feature, REC->hob_nsect)

We could convert that in the output where it has:

  print fmt: "ata_port=%u ata_dev=%u tag=%d proto=%s cmd=%s%s  tf=(%02x/%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x/%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x/%02x)"
                                                            ^
                                                            |
              libata_trace_parse_subcmd(p, REC->cmd, REC->feature, REC->hob_nsect)

Instead of printing:

sleep-47414 [006] 313119.147175: ata_qc_issue:         [FAILED TO PARSE] ata_port=1 ata_dev=0 tag=22 cmd=96 dev=64 lbal=24 lbam=69 lbah=253 nsect=176 feature=16 hob_lbal=2 hob_lbam=0 hob_lbah=0 hob_nsect=0 hob_feature=0 ctl=120 proto=6 flags=0x726f776b00000000


It could print:


sleep-47414 [006] 313119.147175: ata_qc_issue:         ata_port=1 ata_dev=0 tag=22 [..]libata_trace_parse_subcmd(p, cmd=96, feature=16, nob_nsect=0) [...]

And continue to parse everything else it understands.

The TRACE_EVENT() macro that defines that mess is:

TRACE_EVENT(mm_page_alloc,

        TP_PROTO(struct page *page, unsigned int order,
                        gfp_t gfp_flags, int migratetype),

        TP_ARGS(page, order, gfp_flags, migratetype),

        TP_STRUCT__entry(
                __field(        unsigned long,  pfn             )
                __field(        unsigned int,   order           )
                __field(        unsigned long,  gfp_flags       )
                __field(        int,            migratetype     )
        ),

        TP_fast_assign(
                __entry->pfn            = page ? page_to_pfn(page) : -1UL;
                __entry->order          = order;
                __entry->gfp_flags      = (__force unsigned long)gfp_flags;
                __entry->migratetype    = migratetype;
        ),

        TP_printk("page=%p pfn=0x%lx order=%d migratetype=%d gfp_flags=%s",
                __entry->pfn != -1UL ? pfn_to_page(__entry->pfn) : NULL,
                __entry->pfn != -1UL ? __entry->pfn : 0,
                __entry->order,
                __entry->migratetype,
                show_gfp_flags(__entry->gfp_flags))
);


So looking at the first line:

                __entry->pfn != -1UL ? pfn_to_page(__entry->pfn) : NULL,

The pfn_to_page() must be a macro expanded to that huge output. 

The thing is, there's no way that user space can know what the result of
that pfn_to_page is, as that information is hidden inside the kernel.

I do not see that expanding like the above in the latest kernel. I'm
guessing the kernel you have has that crazy expansion of pfn_to_page() though.

Probably the best thing that user space can do is to just do what it does
now and simply output the event fields. We do not want to have the output
showing all that builtin_constant_p() and size_of() callers.
