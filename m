Yes, I know what caused the breakage.

The latest libtraceevent and libtracefs should work with all previous
versions of the kernel. TIMESTAMP was not implemented in the kernel when
kbuffer.c added it. That was my mistake and it will not happen again.

trace-cmd uses the latest libtracevent and libtracefs, and it works on
kernels back to 2.6.32 (when tracing was added). Using the latest
libtraceevent will work on all older kernels.

All should be good. What exactly are you worried about?
