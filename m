I have to admit that I personally do not use python, and this code was
added by others.

Note, there's patches to fix the python code, but as I'm not a python
expert, I'm still holding off to applying them.

Not sure if this helps you, but you may want to look at this:

  https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-trace-devel/patch/Y+w51nOhNd+PGo/k@slm.duckdns.org/

Does the above help you?
