Well, under the term "parse" I understand "to verify, whether the tokens
match the grammar" (i.e. that a function name has to be followed by '(' and
')' characters, that there have to be e.g. two args, separated by ',' etc.

By adding __builtin_expect support, you have added exactly this --> it now
knows the function, but does nothing around it.

Then it comes to interpreting the code, that is also done in libtraceevent,
isn't it? Does the parser produce some intermediate rep? What code performs
the interpretation?

Good, so I understood your approach correctly.

There are several events. However, I don't know who takes the tracepoint description
and generates the terribly complicated expression below.

OK, so if parsing does not fail, the code is interpreted by libtraceevent?

In such case, the missing functions should be added or added as bypassed
the similar way (e.g. __builtin_constant_p could be replaced by 0). Then,
for example the sizeof should be accepted by the parser, but also interpreted
correctly...
