The 2025 Tracing Summit is a two-day, single-track conference on the topic =
of tracing. The event focuses on software and hardware tracing, gathering d=
evelopers and end-users of tracing and trace analysis tools. The main goal =
of the Tracing Summit is to provide space for discussion between people of =
the various areas that benefit from tracing, namely parallel, distributed a=
nd/or real-time systems, as well as kernel development.

We are welcoming 30 minute presentations from both end users and developers=
, on topics covering, but not limited to:

- Investigation workflow of real-time, latency, and throughput issues,
- Trace collection and extraction,
- Trace filtering,
- Trace aggregation,
- Trace formats,
- Tracing multi-core systems,
- Trace abstraction,
- Trace modeling,
- Automated trace analysis (e.g. dependency analysis),
- Tracing large clusters and distributed systems,
- Hardware-level tracing (e.g. DSP, GPU, bare-metal),
- Trace visualization,
- Interaction between debugging and tracing,
- Tracing remote control,
- Analysis of large trace datasets,
- Cloud trace collection and analysis,
- Integration between trace tools,
- Live tracing & monitoring,
- Dynamic instrumentation,
- Programmable tracing (e.g. eBPF).

Talks can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and yet non-=
existing technologies (that are compelling to end-users). Talks covering in=
teresting or challenging tracing use cases are also welcome as they can rev=
eal future directions or tooling needs.

Please understand that this open forum is not the proper place to present s=
ales or marketing pitches, nor technologies which are prevented from being =
freely used in open source.

Please send any questions about this conference to <info@tracingsummit.org>.

This event is organized by EfficiOS [4] on behalf of the Linux Foundation D=
iagnostic and Monitoring Workgroup [5].
