So what happened was the old 12 byte version of TIME_STAMP was never
actually implemented in the kernel. When we finally got around to
implementing it, we only needed 8 bytes for it, so it became 8 bytes.

I made the mistake of adding that code in kbuffer.c before it was ever
implemented in the kernel and said it would be 12 bytes.

Now that it has been implemented, it's not going to change. 8 bytes is now
an API. Any more updates should not cause a problem with libtraceevent as
there's many more tools that depend on it working. And the fact that it is
no longer in the kernel, guarantees more that the interface will remain
stable.

rasdaemon should be using the external libtraceevent library because it
will be able to get more information out of any new data. Newer kernels
should not break existing libtracevent, but it may just skip over new
features.
